A simple Ext JS 4.x contact-list app to explore DeftJS.

Also, I'm exploring Jasmine for unit testing with this app.

To access the app itself, load the index.html from a web server (loading
from the file system may not work and is untested). To access the Jasmine
tests, load test.html.

The index-offline.html and test-offline.html files assume that you have a copy
of (or symlink to) Ext JS 4.x in the lib/ directory and point the script tags
and css links to that instead of the Sencha CDN.
